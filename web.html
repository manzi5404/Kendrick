<p>The history of the personal computer (PC) is a long and fascinating one. It began in the 1970s, when a number of companies began to develop computers that were small and affordable enough for individuals to use in their homes.

  One of the first successful PCs was the Apple II, which was released in 1977. The Apple II was a revolutionary machine, and it helped to popularize the idea of the personal computer. Other early PCs included the Commodore 64 and the IBM PC.
  
  The 1980s saw the rise of the PC as a dominant force in the computer market. The IBM PC, in particular, was a major success, and it helped to establish the PC as the standard platform for business computing. The 1980s also saw the emergence of Microsoft as a major software company, with its MS-DOS operating system becoming the dominant operating system for PCs.
  
  The 1990s saw the continued growth of the PC market, with the development of new and innovative technologies such as the World Wide Web. The 1990s also saw the rise of the internet, which helped to connect PCs together and create a global network of computers.
  
  The 2000s saw the PC market mature, with the focus shifting to areas such as portability and wireless connectivity. The 2000s also saw the emergence of new types of devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which began to compete with PCs for market share.
  
  Today, the PC market is still a major force in the computer industry, but it is facing increasing competition from other types of devices. However, PCs are still an important part of many people's lives, and they are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>
